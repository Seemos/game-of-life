# Game Of Life
A Java-based implementation of the famous game of life with a graphical user interface.
If a cell is at the edge of the window, cells on the other side of the window are counted as neighbors. This means that the plane of cells does not behave like an infinite plane but like the surface of a torus.


The height and width of the game as well as the size of a cell can be set in the UI when launching.
After starting a game, patterns can be drawn by clicking on the newly opened window.
The "start/stop" button starts and stops the updating of the cells.
